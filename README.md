This Python program simulates the ticket booking and management system for an electric mountain railway. The railway makes four return trips every day, and passengers can purchase tickets for each journey.

Features:

1. Start of the Day:
   - The program initializes the screen display for the start of the day.
   - Data structures are set up to track the total passengers and money taken for each train journey.

2. Purchasing Tickets:
   - Tickets can be purchased for a single passenger or a group.
   - The program checks ticket availability for the specified journey and calculates the total price, including any group discount.
   - The screen display and data for totals are updated accordingly.

3. End of the Day:
   - Displays the number of passengers and total money for each train journey.
   - Calculates and displays the total number of passengers and total amount of money taken for the day.
   - Finds and displays the train journey with the most passengers that day.

How to Use:

1. Run the Program:
   - Execute the program by running the Python script (electric_mountain_railway.py).

2. Interact with the Program:
   - The program provides prompts for ticket purchases and displays the screen with available tickets.
   - Follow the prompts to purchase tickets and observe the screen updates.

3. End of Day Summary:
